### Side projects for learning and experimenting

#### SaaS solution for the pastry and bakery industry _(private repository)_
![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=angular,nestjs,postgres,tailwind,vitest,ts,html,css,pnpm,docker,githubactions)

_This project serves as a **learning-first initiative**, designed with an enterprise mindset from the start. Although currently working towards a small-scale MVP, the architecture is deliberately **over-engineered** to ensure **robustness**, **maintainability**, and **scalability**. It's a hands-on application of advanced software design patterns, providing me with transferable skills for building large-scale, resilient applications._

- **Frontend:** Built with **Angular**, styled using **Tailwind CSS** and Taiga UI (component library).
- **Backend:** Using **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL** with **TypeORM**, and **Swagger** for API documentation.
- **Testing:** Integrates unit/integration tests with **Vitest** and end-to-end tests with **Playwright**.
- **CI/CD & Deployment:** Leverages **Docker** for containerization and **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD.
- **Architecture**: A **monorepo** built on principles of **Clean Architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and **Hexagonal Architecture**.

#### [Mobile application for consistent daily and weekly journaling](https://github.com/2uent1n/lunadir)
![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=kotlin,spring,postgres,gradle)

_This project is my way of getting more familiar with the **Kotlin** language and the **Spring Boot** framework. It's also an opportunity to explore **cross-platform mobile development**._

- **Backend**: I've started building the API with **Spring Boot** and **Kotlin**, connected to a **PostgreSQL** database. 
- **Mobile Application**: I plan to build the mobile app using **Compose Multiplatform**.
